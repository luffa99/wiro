### WirO is a mobile phone application which allows recording Orienteering runs, or other types of sport runs, using a smartphone and NFC tags. The app records split and total times and uses NFC tags to check stations passage. Runs are synchronized with a server which shows auto-results.

If you are interested in developing further this app, you're welcome! You can also contact me at webmaster(Ã¤t)scom-mendrisio.ch.

> At the moment the app is localized in _italian_, but this will change (hopefully) asap!
