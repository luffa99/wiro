### WirO is a mobile phone application which allows recording Orienteering runs, or other types of sport runs, using a smartphone and NFC tags. The app records split and total times and uses NFC tags to check stations passage. Runs are synchronized with a server which shows auto-results.

If you are interested in developing further this app, you're welcome!
